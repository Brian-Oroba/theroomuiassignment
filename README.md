This is a Selenium project that automates the UI
I've implemented the key-word driven framework.
The start browser class helps in opening the browser, the configurator support helps in file inputs.
The screen recorder class records your screen, keeping a record of the operations.
The action driver class contains all the web action, e.g, typing or clicking.
all the above listed classes are under the room package.

Under the test directory we have the room package which has a homepage class where the tests to be conducted are defined.
the next class is the common functions which defines the functions in the object repository; it defines the tests specified under the homepage class.
the next class is the TC homepage whereby all the tests are run.
the last class is the config properties where the web url is defined.
